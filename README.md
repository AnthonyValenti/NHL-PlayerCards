# Data Explanation
All stats displayed are percentage rankings of a players WAR- Wins above replacement. This stat aims to quantify how many extra wins an individual player will earn
their team when comapred to a replacement level NHL player (a 13th forward or 7th defenceman). WAR is typically seen online expressed as a raw value, however it is not intuitive for fans to understand what a good WAR value is, this is why I decided to express values as percent rankings instead. 

OVR% - A players combined overall WAR. 

SHT% - A players shooting WAR at even-strength. 

EVO% - A players total even strength offence WAR. 

TKY% - A players take-away WAR at even-stength. 

EVD% - A players total even strength defence WAR. 

PEN% - A players penalty differential (peanlties taken VS penalties drawn) WAR. 

PP% - A players poweplay WAR. 

PK% - A players penalty-kill WAR.
