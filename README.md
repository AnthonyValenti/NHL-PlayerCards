# Data Explanation
All stats displayed are percentage rankings of a players WAR- Wins above replacement. This stat aims to quantify how many extra wins an individual player will earn
their team when comapred to a replacement level NHL player (a 13th forward or 7th defenceman). WAR is typically seen online expressed as a raw value, however it is not intuitive for fans to understand what a good WAR value is, this is why I decided to express values as percent rankings instead. 

OVR% - A players combined overall WAR. 

SHT% - A players shooting WAR at even-strength. 

EVO% - A players total even strength offence WAR. 

TKY% - A players take-away WAR at even-stength. 

EVD% - A players total even strength defence WAR. 

PEN% - A players penalty differential (peanlties taken VS penalties drawn) WAR. 

PP% - A players poweplay WAR. 

PK% - A players penalty-kill WAR.

Here is Leafs star centre Auston Matthews, the top of the card displays his basic information such as team, position, age and cap hit(salary). Below are all of his stats expressed as wins above replacemnt, in which he ranks in the top percentile for almost every metric. Clearly indictive of a star player.
